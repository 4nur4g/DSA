# Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) Learning Repository

This repository contains my code for learning data structure and algorithm (DSA) concepts. I am following the courses by [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/), a platform that provides interactive and engaging coding lessons.

The courses I am taking are:

- [Algorithms & Data Structures for Beginners](https://neetcode.io/courses/dsa-for-beginners/0): This course covers the basics of DSA, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting and searching algorithms.
- [Advanced Algorithms](https://neetcode.io/courses/advanced-algorithms/0): This course covers more advanced topics of DSA.

In addition to the courses, I am also solving the [Blind 75](https://neetcode.io/practice) problems, which are a curated list of 75 popular Leetcode problems that are frequently asked in coding interviews.

My goal is to complete the courses and the problems within 5 days from the date of first commit (June 7th, 2023). I will update this readme with my progress.

I hope this repository will help me improve my coding skills and prepare me for future challenges. Feel free to check out my code and give me feedback or suggestions.
